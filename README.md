# **Project Proposal**

Hi everyone,

Kyndra and I, both computer science students, are looking for teammates to join us on our project. We’re thinking about focusing on a theme related to military or sports. We’re undergraduates, but we're open to working with either undergraduate or graduate students.

If you're interested in collaborating, please reach out! You can contact us at **spmi6902@colorado.edu** or Kyndra at **Kyndra.Nelson@colorado.edu**.

### **(1) Project Title**  
A concise and informative title

### **(2) Team Members**  
- Spartak Mikayelyan, CSCI 4502  
- Kyndra Nelson, CSCI 4502

### **(3) Brief Project Description**  
We will be working with both datasets to identify trends within the data to help MMA fighters learn more about the statistics behind the matches. This data can help fighters improve faster while maintaining safer training methods.

**Key Questions/Inquiries**:
- Orthodox vs Southpaw vs Switch with win ratio  
- Career trajectory after fighting (if data is available, with a focus on ex-military fighters)
- Comparing 2023 data vs all-time data since 1994  
- Punches landed: Male division vs Female division  
- Success by age: Comparing fighters under 20 vs over 20
